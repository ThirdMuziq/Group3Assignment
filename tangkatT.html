my name is Tangkat Shehu
I am mwaghavul by tribe
placed in group three assignment group
my experience during the first week was a little stressful
taking in too much informatiion at a time for a novice in the field of programming
i have come to know so many things that changed my peerspective about coding in computer
with time and practice i believe with all my heart i can manipulate code with computer
i can tell computer what to do. programming  is all about writing instructions which the computer act upon
this program (code plateau) is timely. i have always wanted to learn things about computer
how to operate and maniipulate anything on the computer.
